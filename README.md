## Deployment with GitHub Pages

This portfolio is designed for static deployment, making it perfect for GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository** (if you haven't already). You can name it `your-username.github.io` for a personal site, or any other name if it's a project site.
2.  **Push your code** to this new repository.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin [https://github.com/maniharshitha19/your-portfolio-repo-name.git](https://github.com/maniharshitha19/your-portfolio-repo-name.git)
    git push -u origin main
    ```
3.  Go to your repository on GitHub.
4.  Navigate to **Settings** -> **Pages**.
5.  Under "Build and deployment", select **Deploy from a branch**.
6.  Choose `main` (or `master`) as your branch and `/ (root)` as your folder, then click **Save**.
7.  GitHub Pages will then build and deploy your site. Your portfolio will be accessible at `https://your-username.github.io/your-portfolio-repo-name/` (or `https://your-username.github.io/` if you named the repo `your-username.github.io`).

Enjoy your new portfolio!
